Brief description of myself.

## About Me

I'm a current PhD student in Engineering Science with focus on Intermittency Analysis of Discrete-Time Dynamical Systems modelling neuronal behavior. The organization for which I'm working is the Institute of Advances Studies in Engineering and Technology (IDIT) based on the Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences Faculty (FCEFyN) from the National University of Cordoba (UNC). The PhD is carried on in the context of an internal fellowship conceeded by the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET).

As for today, I've taken (and I am currently taking) courses related to my field of study, these being:
  - Diseño de Software para Cómputo Científico 2021 (Software design for scientific computation)
  - Redes Neuronales 2021 (Neural Networks)
  - Física Computacional 2022 (Computational Physics)
  - Probabilidad y Procesos Estocásticos 2022 (Probability and Stochastic Processes)
  - Sistemas Dinámicos 2022 (Dynamical Systems)
  - Dinámica no Lineal y Caos 2022 (Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos)
  - Computación paralela 2023 (Parallel Computing - HPC)


I'm in active search for works in map-based neuronal dynamical models that show intermittency of any kind. And anything related to the study of both continuous and discrete-time dynamical systems.
